 abstract = {We design and evaluate a novel layout ﬁne-tuning technique for node-link diagrams that facilitates exemplar-based adjustment of a group of substructures in batching mode. The key idea is to transfer user modiﬁcations on a local substructure to other substructures in the entire graph that are topologically similar to the exemplar. We ﬁrst precompute a canonical representation for each substructure with node embedding techniques and then use it for on-the-ﬂy substructure retrieval. We design and develop a light-weight interactive system to enable intuitive adjustment, modiﬁcation transfer, and visual graph exploration. We also report some results of quantitative comparisons, three case studies, and a within-participant user study.},
